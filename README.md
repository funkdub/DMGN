â€‹                          **The overall framework of our proposed DMGN.**

## Installation

The model is built in PyTorch 1.2.0 and tested on Ubuntu 16.04 environment (Python3.7, CUDA9.0, cuDNN7.5).

You can installation the environment via the following:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Testing

First, you should select the model of one task in line 18 eval.py. 

Download the pre-trained models [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aOySJ4ndZ0F_GWoMMl6m4Y5dn1Z2v2oC?usp=sharing).

Put the downloaded .pth files into ./checkpoints/ .

```
python eval.py
```
